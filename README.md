# webscrapingwithR
In this project, I will build a specialized R program to crawl, parse and extract useful information from online websites. 
I selected Abstract and Applied Analysis journal's website (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aaa/contents/year/2021/) for scraping.
Given an input year, the objective is to extract all articles published in/after that year from this journal. As a start point, I will extract the following 8 fields for each article:Title, Authors, Author Affiliations, Correspondence Author, Publish Date, Abstract, Keywords, Full Paper (Text format).
Given an input year, the program is expected to crawl the journalâ€™s website automatically, and parse and extract useful fields for each crawled article. The program is expected to store the extracted information into a plain file elegantly. (One column for one field.)
